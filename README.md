HissDict - a pure-Python Dictionary implementation
==================================================
HissDict is an Apache2 licensed dictionary implementation in
pure-Python, that uses [Collections' Abstract Base Classes](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.abc.html) 
to model the CPython builtin dict. The major motivation is to illustrate performance differences between the two implementations.

Inspired by Grant "Sir Hiss" Jenks (@grantjenks) and his excellent [SortedContainers](http://www.grantjenks.com/docs/sortedcontainers/) 
project.
